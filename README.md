## 🚀 Key Features

### 🏢 Comprehensive Management
Owners can manage their stores via a sleek **ox_lib** interface.
- **Real-time Balance**: Add or withdraw funds from the business account.
- **Stock Control**: Add items from your inventory directly to the store shelves.
- **Price Customization**: Adjust sell prices on the fly without needing a server restart.
- **Category Organization**: Group items into custom categories (Tools, Weapons, Food, etc.) for a better customer experience.

### 🚚 Dynamic Delivery Missions
Keep the shelves full with a built-in mission system.
- **Stock Requests**: Owners create missions with specific quantities and rewards.
- **Driver Bonuses**: Set an **Extra Delivery Fee** to attract players to fulfill your orders.
- **Configurable Limits**: Global and per-item limits on `min_request` and `max_request`.

### 🛡️ Hardened Security & Optimization
- **Race-Condition Protection**: Mission claiming is protected by server-side mutex logic.
- **Anti-Exploit**: Time-based validation prevents instant mission completion hacks.
- **Proximity Sync**: Database updates are broadcast only to nearby players to reduce network overhead.
- **Safe Loading**: Coordinate decoding is protected by `pcall` to prevent server crashes on malformed data.
